    Dihydrogen Monoxide Dihydrogen monoxide, also known as hydroxyl acid or DHMO1,
    is a dangerous substance that2: is the major component of acid rain, contributes to the greenhouse effect,
    may cause severe burns, is fatal if inhaled, contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,
    accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals,
    may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes,
    and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients. Despite the danger,
    DHMO is often used: as an industrial solvent and coolant, in nuclear power plants in the
    production of StyrofoamTM, as a fire retardant, in many forms of cruel animal research,
    as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products, in the distribution of pesticides.
    Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
    1The more common chemical formula is H2O. 2Source: Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide.


    The changes you want to make are:

    1. The page should have the title (changes the tab name) Dangers of DHMO.
    2. Mark the first line with the tags for the biggest heading.
    3. Give the next two words a strong (bold) appearance.
    4. Emphasize (italicize) the first occurrence of hydroxyl acid and DHMO
    5. All numbers except the 2 in H2O should be superscripted l
    6. Mark the letters TM behind Styrofoam as superscript.
    7. The 2 in H2O should be subscripted.
    8. Put paragraph tags around the different paragraphs of the article
    9. If you would like to keep the original spacing on the lists,
    you will want to use break tags after each comma-->

    <!--Q 2

    For this exercise, you will make an ordered list of unordered lists. The example topic will be a multi-stop shopping trip.
    Suggested steps:

    Create all of the ordered list tags first. One ol tag at the top and bottom, with three sets of li tags. The three list items could be groceries, hardware, and electronics
    Under each list item, but before the closing li tag, create an unordered list. Each of the three unordered lists needs to be within the li tags of the ordered list.
    The items for them could be:
    Apples, oranges, bananas
    Hammer, nails, duct tape
    Earphones, Movies, Fan-->
    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            groceries
            <ul>
                <li>Apples</li>
                <li>oranges</li>
                <li>bananas</li>

    <!--Q 3

    For this exercise, you will try out the attributes colspan and rowspan:

    Colspan makes a cell go across multiple columns in a table. It is often used for making titles or headings
    Rowspan makes a cell go down multiple rows.
    You will try to reproduce the table shown below that lists some classes:


    Hints:

    The title on the top is done with a colspan of 2
    The CS cell is spanning three rows, English 2, and ComputerScience 1
    There are 7 rows in this table. Many of them will just have one class name in it
    Adding borders will help you line things up better. You can just add "borders=2" as an attribute to the table tag-->
    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <table border="2">
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">Title</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3" class="subject">CS</td>
            <td rowspan="2" class="subject">English</td>
            <td rowspan="1" class="subject">Computer Science</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
